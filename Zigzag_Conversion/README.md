# Zigzag Conversion Solution

The **Zigzag Conversion** problem (from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-conversion/description/)) involves rearranging a given string into a zigzag pattern based on a specified number of rows, and then reading the result row by row. Here's a concise explanation of the solution:

## Problem Description
Given a string and a number of rows:
1. Distribute the characters of the string along the rows in a zigzag pattern.
2. Start from the top row, move downwards to the bottom row, and then upwards back to the top, repeatedly.
3. Finally, read the characters row by row to get the converted string.

### Example
For the string `"Hello"` and `3` rows:
- Characters are distributed as follows:

```plaintext
H   O
E L
L
```

- The resulting string is `"HOELL"`.

## Solution Approach
To solve this problem efficiently:
1. **Track the Current Row and Direction**: Use two essential variables:
 - `current_row`: Keeps track of the current row.
 - `direction`: Indicates the movement direction (downward or upward).
2. **Iterate Through Characters**: For each character in the string:
 - Append the character to the appropriate row.
 - Update the `current_row` based on the `direction`.
 - Reverse the `direction` when the top or bottom row is reached.
3. **Concatenate Rows**: After processing all characters, combine all rows into the final result.

## Key Insights
- The zigzag pattern ensures that characters are distributed along rows in a structured way, alternating between downward and upward movements.
- The process involves a simple iteration through the string with constant time updates to the `current_row` and `direction`.
- The solution uses an array of strings to represent rows, making the implementation straightforward and efficient.

This approach ensures clarity and efficiency while solving the Zigzag Conversion problem.
