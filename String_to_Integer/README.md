## Solution Recap: String to Integer (atoi)

### Problem Overview
The problem, available on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/), requires converting a string to a 32-bit signed integer. The solution must handle edge cases such as leading whitespace, optional signs (`+` or `-`), and invalid characters, while ensuring the result remains within the 32-bit integer range.

### Key Steps in the Solution

1. **Remove Leading Whitespace**:
   The solution begins by using the `strip` method to eliminate any leading whitespace in the string:
   ```python
   s = s.strip()
   ```

2. **Parse the Numeric Part**:
   A while loop processes the string to extract valid numeric characters. The condition:
   ```python
   while i < len(s) and (s[i].isdigit() or (i == 0 and s[i] in "+-")):
   ```
	•	Ensures the loop runs as long as there are valid characters in the string.
	•	Base Conditions:
	•	i < len(s): Prevents out-of-bounds errors.
	•	i == 0: Ensures the first character is checked for a valid sign (+ or -).
	•	Checks whether the current character is numeric or the first character is a valid sign.

3. **Extract the Numeric Substring**:
   After the loop, the numeric portion of the string is extracted:
   ```python
   numeric_part = s[:i]
   ```
   If numeric_part is empty or only contains a sign (+ or -), the function returns 0.


4. **Ensure the Result Fits in a 32-bit Range**:
    The function ensures the result falls within the range of a 32-bit signed integer:
    ```python
    if -(2**31) <= result < 2**31:
    return result
    return -(2**31) if result < -(2**31) else 2**31 - 1
    ```
